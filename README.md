### Basic idea
Our e-voting project follows the following rules 
1. The vote given by a person cannot be seen by any other person.
1. People living in all region having an internet connection can vote.
1. Only eligible people can vote and that also only once.
1. The proposals of the candidates remain the same throughout the election.
1. The election results are displayed just after the end of elections.

*We will not implement the process of including new people who have just turned 18 or check if all the eligibl voters are there in the list(example idea 2 and 3 at the codefundoo website)*
### Implementation
#### People

* **Voters** They cast their votes by going at their respective constituencies. They are given the wallet pin and ID by their respective local people.
